## General Info

This is a re-creation of same project that I had previously done in plain Javascript. I just wanted to give it a go and challenge myself to do the same in React. In fact one can achieve quite a lot with Github API. In this website, you can see both the popular repositories of the week and user details. User can choose between range of several programming languages to get popular repositories of that language. The input field on the top will give possibility to search for users on Github. You can just give it a try and find your own account there!
